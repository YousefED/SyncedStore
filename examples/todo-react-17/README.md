# React 17 Todo MVC example

This example demonstrates how you can use SyncedStore to build a collaborative version of the [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com) app.

The code that sets up our store is defined in [src/store.ts](src/store.ts). By using the `useSyncedStore` hook, our React components (starting at [src/App.tsx](src/App.tsx)) are easy to read and update automatically.
