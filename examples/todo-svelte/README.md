# Svelte Todo MVC example

This example demonstrates how you can use ReactiveCRDT to build a collaborative version of the [Todo MVC](http://todomvc.com) app.

The code is based on the [official Svelte Todo MVC example](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte-todomvc). Some changes were needed to make the App work with ReactiveCRDT.

# Running

    npm run dev
